Clone VM || create a snapshot && open VM.

How does a virtual machine work and what is its purpose?
	#

The basic differences between CentOS and Debian?
	#

Why debian?
	#

What is the difference between aptitude, apt?
	#

What is APPArmor?
	#

Connect to VM as a created user (which isn’t a root).
	Ensure the password follows the required policy (2 days min, 7, 30 days max).
		sudo chage -l username

check OS.
	lsb_release -a || cat /etc/os-release

Check UFW status.
	sudo ufw status

check SSH service.
	sudo systemctl status ssh

Check user name.
	must be user 42 login
	must belong to groups sudo and user42
		getent group sudo
		getent group user42

Add new user for evaluator.
	sudo adduser new_username

Explain how to implement the password policy.
	# method 1 vs method 2

Add evaluator user to group.
	sudo groupadd evaluating
	sudo usermod -aG evaluating your_new_username
	getent group evaluating

Elaborate on advantages/disadvantages of the password policy.
	#

Check the hostname of the machine is correctly formatted (user@login42).
	hostnamectl

Modify hostname.
	sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname
	sudo reboot (changes must be present after reboot).

Restore original hostname.
	sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname
	sudo reboot (changes must be present after reboot).

Display VM partion table.
	lsblk

Elaborate on partition table, primary, logical, encrypted, what is LVM and how it works.
	#

Check is sudo is installed.
	dpkg -l | grep sudo

Assign new user to sudo group.
	sudo usermod -aG sudo username

Display and explain sudo rules.
	sudo visudo
	#

Verify /var/log/sudo/sudo.log
	check contents of file for sudo command history
	use sudo command, check if file was updated


Check if UFW is installed and working.
	sudo ufw status numbered

Elaborate on what is UFW and why is helpful to use it.
	#
	list active rules for ufw
		check for port 4242
		add new rule
		check new rule was added
		delete rule

Elaborate on SSH service, what is it, what is it used for.
	#secure shell, allows 2 computers to securely talk to each other
		check service is installed and operational using port 4242
			sudo service ssh status
		connect to vm with host terminal using evaluators username
			ssh evaluator@127.0.0.1 -p 4242
		make sure you cannot use SSH with the “root” user as stated in the subject.
			ssh login42@127.0.0.1 -p 4242 / ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 4242

Ask the student how their script works and see their code for it
	cd /usr/local/bin && vim monitoring.sh

What is cron?
	How does the script run every 10 minutes from when the server starts?
		use sleep.sh?

	Check if script runs with dynamic values
		sudo crontab -u root -e (***change 10 value to 1***)

	Stop/Start the script from running on startup.
		sudo cronstop
		sudo cronstart

	At startup, check if the script still exists in the same place,
	The rights have remained unchanged and that it has not been modified.
		sudo reboot
		sudo crontab -u root -e

Script notes.
